- **Computer**: I bought a 16GB RAM 2022 Macbook Pro, and I'm liking it so far. Was a bit on the fence, since the Air genuinely felt lighter to me, but I think the specs make the pro worth it. I was using my old 2013 MBP before this, and this is so, so fast by comparison. 

- **Keyboard**: At home, an Akko 3084. Sometimes a Keychron K2.  

- **Editor**: VSCode with the high contrast theme. Sometimes Cursor. 

- **Browser**: Chrome. 

- **Browser Extensions:**
    - Self Control 

- **Terminal**: terminal.app 

- **Desktop Software:** 
    - Raycast 
    - CleanShotX 
    - ScreenStudio 
    - Rectangle

- **Web Services I pay for:** 
    - LunchMoney 
    - Are.na
    - ~~Notion~~ (paid software, but I got grandfathered into a free education plan ðŸ¤«) 

- **Library Memberships:** 
    - New York Public Library
    - Brooklyn Public Library 
    - ~~San Francisco Public Library~~ (cancelled when I moved)
