This website is a collection of markdown files stored in a [Github repository](https://github.com/deblnia/deblnia.github.io), and deployed via Netlify using Hugo and R's `blogdown` package. It collects no analytics. If you don't tell me, I will never know you were here. 

The design is forked from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/), which is a project that originated with [@drew_mc](https://twitter.com/drew_mc). It is 7 CSS declarations and uses your browser's default accent colors and serif font. The font color is #444. 

I write from either my 15" HP Spectre x360 or my 13" 2011 Mac Book Pro, using either RStudio or VSCode.
