This website is a collection of markdown files stored in a <a href="https://github.com/deblnia/deblnia.github.io" target="_blank">Github reposoty</a>, and deployed via Netlify using Hugo and R's `blogdown` package. I bought the domain name from Google Domains for $12/year. This site collects no analytics. If you don't tell me, I will never know you were here. 

The design is forked from <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a>, which is a project that originated with <a href="https://twitter.com/drew_mc" target="_blank">@drew_mc</a>. It is 7 CSS declarations and uses your browser's default accent colors and serif font. The font color is #444, and the accent color is #DCDCDC. 

I write from either my 15" HP Spectre x360 or my 13" 2011 Mac Book Pro, using either RStudio or VSCode.
