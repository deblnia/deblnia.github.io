I'm living in Brooklyn, near Propsect Park. 
 
I'm about halfway through a 12 week batch (my second!) at the Recurse Center. My goals for this batch: 

- 500 commits by the end of the year (a lifetime high). Here's how I'm doing.

- At least 5 Pairing Sessions (ideally double digits)
- At least 2 Thursday Demos 
- At least 2 Blog Posts 
- (Tentatively stealing this from my friend [Christina](https://tunapee.bearblog.dev/now/)) 100 Shitty Projects.

I'm also: 

- Playing soccer at Dean Playground and Brooklyn Bridge Park
- Coaching Girl's U11 soccer with South Bronx United and my friend Shaun
- Taking Fractal University's Freestyle Cooking class 
- Apply to graduate school (masters and PhD ?!) this cycle 
- Taking the LSAT in January
