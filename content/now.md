I'm living in Brooklyn, near Prospect Park. 

I'm taking the LSAT in June, playing soccer at Bedford Armory, and volunteering with [SBU](https://southbronxunited.org/) (coaching Girl's Under-11s!) and [Asylum Support Clinic](https://www.asylumsupportclinic.org/)'s Cycle 12. 

My [Erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4 (Deblina Mukherjee > James Evans > Nathan Srebro > Noga Alon > Paul Erdos)
