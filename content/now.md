I'm living in Brooklyn, but will be looking for a new apartment (hopefully still in the Park Slope area) after July. I'm also settling into a new job at [The Browser Company of New York](https://thebrowser.company/) - my first time working at a start-up - and am scheduled to take the LSAT in September. 

I've also been burning through the Nike Run Club's Getting Started 4 week plan, playing soccer at Chelsea Piers Field House, and coaching girls' under-11 soccer with South Bronx United.
