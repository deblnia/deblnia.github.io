I'm living in Brooklyn, near Propsect Park. 
 
I'm about halfway through a 12 week batch (my second!) at the Recurse Center. [The Plan](https://www.notion.so/deblina/THE-PLAN-RC-V2-FALL-24-12d45d2fcf2f809a823bdefb239af8db) is here.

I'm also playing soccer at Brooklyn Bridge Park, coaching GU11 soccer with South Bronx United and my friend Shaun, and applying to graduate school (master's and PhD this cycle, taking the LSAT in January).
