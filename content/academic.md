I'm mainly affiliated with the [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/), where I've been a research assistant since 2018. My current projects concern [programming languages](https://www.knowledgelab.org/funding_opportunities/postdoctoral_position_in_how_programming_languages_shape_thought/), and [Genesweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeneSweep). I've been lucky enough to be supported by a [CRASSH grant](https://ccrf.uchicago.edu/undergraduate-research/crassh-research-scholars), and a Metcalf Grant.
