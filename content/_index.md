My name is Deblina Mukherjee. I graduated from the University of Chicago in June 2021, with a major in Sociology and minors in Computer Science and Statistics. I’m from New Jersey, and now live in San Francisco.

I'm a data scientist and software engineer. I've also worked at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">facebook</a> (where I also previously spent two summers as an intern), <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html" target ="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2021/01/25/washington-post-announces-2021-newsroom-engineering-interns/" target="_blank">The Washington Post </a>, <a href="https://mediacloud.org/about" target="_blank"> Media Cloud </a>, <a href="https://civichall.org/" target="_blank">Civic Hall</a>, <a href="http://politics.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">UChicago's IOP</a>, <a href="https://aapidata.com/" target="_blank">AAPI Data</a>, <a href="https://www.vesthq.com/" target="_blank">VestHQ</a>, and the <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/~gulotty/IPElab.html" target="_blank">IPE Lab</a>.
