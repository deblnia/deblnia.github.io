My name is Deblina Mukherjee. I graduated from the University of Chicago in June 2021, with a major in Sociology and minors in Computer Science and Statistics. I’m from New Jersey.

After graduation, I'll be spending some time as a data scientist at <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html" target ="_blank"> Twitter </a>, and some more time as newsroom engineering intern at the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2021/01/25/washington-post-announces-2021-newsroom-engineering-interns/" target="_blank"> Washington Post </a>. I'll start as a full-time data scientist at  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">facebook</a>, where I previously spent two summers as an intern, in December. In the past, I've also worked at <a href="https://mediacloud.org/about" target="_blank"> Media Cloud </a>, <a href="https://civichall.org/" target="_blank">Civic Hall</a>, <a href="http://politics.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">UChicago's IOP</a>, <a href="https://aapidata.com/" target="_blank">AAPI Data</a>, <a href="https://www.vesthq.com/" target="_blank">VestHQ</a>, and the <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/~gulotty/IPElab.html" target="_blank">IPE Lab</a>. I TA’d for <a href="https://cfss.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Computing for the Social Sciences</a> in Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Winter 2021.

At school, I was a member of <a href="http://occam.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Occam's Razor</a>, the founder of <a href="https://github.com/UCOpenData" target="_blank">UChicago's Open Data Project</a>, and, from 2019 to 2021, half the EIC of the <a href="https://chicagoshadydealer.com/" target="_blank">Chicago Shady Dealer</a>.
