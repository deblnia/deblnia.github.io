My name is Deblina Mukherjee. I’m a student at the University of Chicago majoring in Sociology and minoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I’m from New Jersey.

This summer, I’ll be returning to [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) as a data scientist intern. In the past, I’ve worked for [Civic Hall](https://civichall.org/), [UChicago’s IOP](http://politics.uchicago.edu/), [AAPI Data](https://aapidata.com/), [VestHQ](https://www.vesthq.com/), and the [IPE Lab](https://home.uchicago.edu/~gulotty/IPElab.html). I TA’d for [Computing for the Social Sciences](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/) in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020.

Currently, I am half the EIC of the [Chicago Shady Dealer](https://chicagoshadydealer.com/), a member of [Occam’s Razor](http://occam.uchicago.edu/), and the founder of [UChicago’s Open Data Project](https://www.uchicagotechteam.com/open-data-project). In the ‘20-21 academic year, I’ll be the Civic Engagement Chair on the IOP’s [Student Advisory Board](http://politics.uchicago.edu/pages/student-leaders).
