title: What I'm looking For
---

I alternate between blind panic - I just want _a_ job, any port in a storm - but in the past, that has led to a lot of me baseline questioning my job. I wanted to write out what I'm looking for, so that I can proceed in the job search with more integrity. A page towards job-search zen.

I am looking for a role that I can stay in long-term (3-5 years, ideally since that's the amount of time I'd devote to my best alternative, grad school). To do that, I need some things:  

- Purpose

My litmus test for purpose is that it's the thing that makes me excited to get to work on Sunday night. I've been excited to get to work because I liked the people I worked with, and I was excited to see them the next day. I've been excited to get to work because I liked the product and felt like I was having a positive impact on the world. I've been excited because someone is learning generously, and I will have the opportunity to learn.  

- Autonomy 

There are a couple aspects to autonomy as well. Financial, first. I used to not say that I had compensation expectations, but I definitely do. I live in a high cost of living area that I do not intend to leave (New York), and I have hobbies (playing soccer, pottery, poker) that cost money. I need to be paid enough to maintain that lifestyle. Ideally, I would be paid more than enough to maintain that lifestyle, so that I can save money and build capital while I'm at it. 

The other aspect is very logistical. I need to have control over my schedule. I take walks during the day to think, I have doctor's appointments, and I want to be able to make time for my hobbies, friends, and family. Managing my time is how I build my volitional muscles.  

I also have some logistical constraints: I want to stay in New York, as I said. I don't mind coming into an office every day, though I would prefer hybrid / flexible work policy. 

- Mastery 

I want to become dramatically better. I'm not particuarly picky about what, but I want to improve in tangible, ideally measurably ways. I need to push the edges of my abilities. 


I am not interested in organizations that exhibit the following behaviors:

1. Information Assymmetry. 

2. Grading without first teaching. This undermines the ideal of a blameless engineering culture.  

This is part of mastery. Deliberate practice requires specific tasks, tactical feedback, and  coaches who will see you throuhg the prcess. 

3. Unjustified or unimportant work.

Work done for theater (impressing a manager, work that only matters to a manager + 1 or 2) undercuts my sense of purpose and autonomy.  

4. Nothing embarassing.
 
This extends to both sectors - not interested in web3, not interested in tools for thought - and to companies. I don't want to work for companies that are in decline,  or executing a poorly conceived "pivot to AI". 

5. Nothing boring. 
 
Most positions at ad-tech companies are dreadfully boring. I'm not interested in ad-tech, unless it's a Trust and Safety role, as that's what I feel aligns with my values.
