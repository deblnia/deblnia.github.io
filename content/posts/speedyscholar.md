title: Speedy Scholar

[Speedy Scholar](https://mynameisdeb-m.gitbook.io/deblina/) is a just-barely-modified fork of Ayman Nadeem's original open-source project. You can tell it's a fork because I used the same platform to deploy it (gitbooks) and because I haven't yet taken out the CS papers that were originally there. I'll do it eventually.

In case Ayman reads this (unlikely), I should just note that I love the idea of open-source summaries of academic articles. Her book is gorgeous, and if she wants to hang out, I am free on Thursday and she could contact me to hang out on Thursday when I am free. The original repo seemed pretty archived though, and I think knowledge stores like this are pretty personal, hence the fork. 

Gitbooks, the best I can tell, used to be a [pretty good looking CLI](https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/javascript/content/). But why be good when you can be bad? It's currently got a gross GUI, keeps asking for my money, and (I'm pretty sure) is ignoring all the custom CSS. Sigh. 

Hopefully this comes in useful though. I still like the idea of grouping all the papers from a class together in one post, but this is better for intentional reading of one-off papers, for "working with the garage door open" and for searching retrospectively. It felt good to build something too, even if it only took like fifteen minutes.
