title: A Belated Return Statement
---

While I was there, I described The Recurse Center to friends as something in between a writer’s retreat and an academic sabbatical for programmers. I had wanted to do a batch for a while, mainly because I read and was impressed by a lot of Recursers' blogs, and also because the [self-directives](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives) continue to resonate with me, even a few months out from my batch. 

1. Work at the edge of your abilities 
2. Build your volitional muscles 
3. Learn Generously

The writing of blogs flows from the last self-directive. Writing down what you know, what you’re thinking about and what you’re working on is all part of learning generously.  

So what did I actually do at RC? Three groups of things, broadly. 

- **Some curriculum based stuff.** Rustlings, a neural net from scratch exercise, the missing semester of CS, and some exercises from SICP
- **Some small free-form projects.** A little web app for George Saunders' writing exercise, tic-tac-toe in Rust. 
- **Some presentations and social stuff**. I gave a presentation about how to play poker at non-programming talks, went to a bunch of poker nights and baseball games (thanks Peter), started using the Nike Run Club (thanks [Zach](https://lippingoff.netlify.app/blog/not-about-running/)), and skimmed the Pragmatic Programmer. 

I leaned hardest into the social stuff, which is odd, since if you ask me now I'll say I mostly kept to myself. To borrow from [T](https://teresaibarra.com/recurse/2024/05/10/last-week.html), I spent a lot of time in survival mode too. It felt good to unwind that 

- What did I learn

- Data science is dead. I’m an engineer.
- Creativity
    - TILs?
- This is my life
    - Paraphrasing T - I spent a lot of time in survival mode too
    - Craft is slow, it’s the long game. But I remember what it feels like to have my fingers poised to typed as if on the polished ivory of a piano instead of a keyboard
    - Being a comedy writer? I have a lot of hobbies

A couple things to do better next time: 


- Next time / todo better
    - Pairing - more in frequency and intensity
        - There’s something I missed about how much you can get done in a day by not pairing
    - Accountability mechanism??
        - Structure, what is like one big thing I can do? Kinda antithetical to the this is my life point
        - What actually motivates me? I’ve said that I’m “socially motivated” but that can turn into people pleasing very fast. I don’t think it’s money because I paid a bunch to move the LSAT - that’s much more a source of frustration and worry.
