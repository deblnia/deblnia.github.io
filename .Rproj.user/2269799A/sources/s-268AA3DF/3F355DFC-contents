My name is Deblina Mukherjee. I'm a student at the University of Chicago majoring in Sociology and minoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I'm from New Jersey. 

This summer, I worked for [facebook](http://facebook.com) as a 
data scientist and for [Civic Hall](http://civichall.org) as a research intern. In the past, I've worked for UChicago's [IOP](http://politics.uchicago.edu), [AAPI Data](http://aapidata.com), [VestHQ](http://vesthq.com), and the [IPE Lab](http://home.uchicago.edu/~gulotty/IPElab.html). I TA'd for [Computing for the Social Sciences](http://cfss.uchicago.edu) in Spring 2019. 

Currently, I'm half the EIC of the [Chicago Shady Dealer](http://chicagoshadydealer.com), a member of [Occam's Razor](http://occam.uchicago.edu), a research assistant in the [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/), and the founder of [UChicago's Open Data Project](https://www.uchicagotechteam.com/open-data-project).
